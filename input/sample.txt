, The Sum of All Fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller .
, `` They 're out there ! ''
, is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly .
- I also wanted a little alien as a friend !
- West Coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate .
- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
-- but certainly hard to hate .
-- but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I 've had in a while .
A delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it 's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow .
